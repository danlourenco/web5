# Application Overview

Web5 Notes is a small notes application meant to demonstrate simple CRUD operations performed via the Web5 SDK. Users can create, edit, update, and delete notes.

In a future update, users will be able to search for notes by either [querying from the DWN](https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-web-nodes/query-from-dwn#querying-records) (still exploring), or within internal application state.

## Motivations

- A simple to do app allows me to explore Web5's CRUD operations without a lot of additional complexity needed to get the app up and running.
- I wanted to explore Web5's SDK further and get a feel for ergonomics, ease of use, and integration into a web application.
- I chose React because it's a familiar framework, and I'm aware that it is used within TBD frontend applications.
